I am trying to make a sorted list of sessions and based on that, create one schedule(ex.) by most/least popular) and put all the people that 
need to be moved in a seperate list. I would also like to create other schedules and determine the amount of people that need to be moved
and compare it to the other schedules to find the best schedule of those set different schedules.
